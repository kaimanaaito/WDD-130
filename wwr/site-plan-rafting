    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to share my personal experience of getting into BYU-Idaho as a Japanese student. Through detailed stories, tips, and resources, the site will provide valuable insights and guidance to Japanese students and others who are interested in studying abroad. The primary audience is prospective international students, especially from Japan, who are navigating the process of applying to universities in the United States. Our goal is to inspire and support them on their journey to study abroad by offering practical advice and encouragement.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The website targets Japanese high school students who want to apply to BYU-Idaho but struggle to find information. Who they are: Japanese students, mostly in their late teens, aiming to study abroad after graduation. What they need: Clear guidance on application steps, deadlines, required documents, English proficiency tests, and scholarship info. Why they need it: Thereâ€™s limited information available in Japan, and they are unsure how to prepare. Access: Mainly through mobile devices, but also desktops/laptops for more detailed tasks.</p>
